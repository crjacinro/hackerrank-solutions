# Hackerrank Solutions

This is a repository that contains my own runnable solutions of random problems in the hackerrank platform.

## How to add a solution?

- Copy and past any existing solution directory.
- Put your solution in the Solution.cpp file.
- Update the SolutionHeader.h with the solution function added.
- Update the test cases in Test.cpp file.
- Run the build script under the build directory using `sh build.sh`.
